# OL-BiddingPricing

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

**OL-BiddingPricing** addresses the problem of **online bidding and pricing** in the context of purchasing campaigns. The main objective is to design and implement strategies that dynamically adjust bids and prices to maximize performance under uncertainty and budget constraints. This involves making sequential decisions with incomplete information about future opportunities.

The project is part of the Online Learning Applications (OLA) course @ Politecnico di Milano and aims to explore **online algorithms** and **learning-based approaches** to optimize bidding policies in real-time scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop online bidding algorithms that can adaptively learn the best pricing strategies.
- Optimize budget usage while maximizing campaign effectiveness.
- Compare classical online algorithms with advanced adaptive and learning-based methods.
- Evaluate the performance of different algorithms through simulations.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms and Methods Used

- **Primal-Dual Online Algorithm:** A classical approach that maintains primal and dual variables to guide bidding decisions based on current resource consumption.
- **Learning-augmented Algorithms:** Techniques that incorporate predictions or learned models to improve online decisions.
- **Adaptive Thresholding:** Methods that adjust bidding thresholds dynamically according to observed data.
- **Budget-aware Strategies:** Algorithms that explicitly consider remaining budget to avoid overspending.
- **Simulation and Evaluation:** Implementation of benchmark scenarios to compare algorithm performance.
